Members:** Dian Jiang, Charles Weber, John Won, and Amir Yaghoobi\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Project Overview\n","\n","**Data Visualization Critic** is an LLM-powered system that automatically reviews data analysis code (Python/R notebooks) and provides expert-level statistical and visualization critiques.\n","\n","### Phase 1 Goal\n","Generate 300 high-quality training examples of:\n","- Flawed data analysis code\n","- Expert critiques explaining the issues\n","- Corrected code with best practices\n","\n","### Key Features\n","- ✅ **Completely Free** (uses Colab GPU, no API costs)\n","- ✅ **15 critical error types** (statistical + visualization)\n","- ✅ **4 realistic domains** (healthcare, business, education, social science)\n","- ✅ **Uses Llama-3-8B** (open-source, state-of-the-art)\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Setup Instructions\n","\n","### Before Running:\n","1. **Enable GPU**: Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU (T4)\n","2. **Accept Llama-3 License**:\n","   - Go to: https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\n","   - Click \"Access gated model\" and accept terms\n","   - Get HuggingFace token: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens\n","   - Add to Colab secrets (🔑 icon): name = `HF_TOKEN`, enable notebook access\n","3. **Keep tab active**: Colab may disconnect if idle\n","\n","### Estimated Time & Cost\n","- **Runtime**: ~4 hours for 300 examples\n","- **Cost**: $0.00 (uses free Colab GPU)\n","- **GPU Memory**: ~6-8 GB (fits in free tier)\n","\n","---"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":20491,"status":"ok","timestamp":1765737627480,"user":{"displayName":"John
